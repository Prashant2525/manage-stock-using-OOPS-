# manage-stock-using-OOPS-
Here in this project I have used the concept of vector pair(just like key-value pair) and also have the concept of multiple stack with the labeled name of each stack. I have similar type program which is done by using c++ but in this project I have used OOPS concept(simply Class and Object).
